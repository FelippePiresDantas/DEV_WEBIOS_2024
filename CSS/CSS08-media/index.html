    <p>They say the sun a na shine for all
        But in some people world
        It never shine at all
        These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh
        Showed you I loved you, and you called me a liar
        Oh, no, no, no, no, no
        Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone
        I've been fiendin' for your love so long
        We can praise Jah in the moonlight
        Baby, if you with me better do right
        And I've been gone too long
        And I'm hoping that you sing my songs (sing my songs)
        I've been on this road for way too long
        I've been hoping that we all get along
        These roads of flames are catching a fire, ahh
        Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar
        Give Jah the thanks and praises
        I've been on my own all along
        But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
        And if I'm telling you the feeling is wrong
        Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
        And when you're feeling alone
        You can call my phone
        Is there a better way to go?
        Teach them something before they lose their soul
        Oh, no, no, no freedom is the road
        Oh, no, no, no coming in from the cold
        Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
        And guiltiness will catch them in the end
        Oh yeah, oh yeah
        They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets (ahh)
        Now you're caught up in a funk with the optic, with the vision (ahh)
        Trying to control your soul and take control
        Oh, no, no, no (ahh)
        No, we don't play that game right here to win power (ahh)
        Give Jah the thanks and praises
         give Jah the thanks and praises
         I sing, give Jah the thanks and praises
         give Jah the thanks and praises
         give Jah the thanks and praises
         give Jah the thanks and praises
        Oh, give Jah all the thanks, the thanks
        The thanks, the thanks, the thanks (give Jah thanks and)
        The thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks 
        Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks and praises 
        (Give Jah thanks and)
        Give Jah the thanks and praises
        </p>
